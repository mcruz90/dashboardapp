# Employee Dashboard for Merchandising Staff

This is a work-in-progress employee dashboard for the merchandising staff of a hospital outpatient pharmacy that I currently work at.

## The problem

Currently, all information required for the merchandiser to do their job is spread across various binders scattered in the pharmacy and word doc files on different computers. The feedback from new hires is that there is too much information to be absorbed in a short period of time and that it would be helpful to have all information easily and quickly retrievable in a central location.

## The proposed solution

As a high-paced work environment and with rotating availability of current staff to train new hires, I was motivated to have a central tool (i.e. a dashboard) where all merchandising staff can easily access training materials, policies, how-to guides, forms, and have a space to leave and follow up notes for other staff.
